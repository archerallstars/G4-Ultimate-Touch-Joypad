# G4-Ultimate-Touch-Joypad
 The ultimate touch joypad for Godot 4.

## Features:
- **Multi-touch supported:** this joypad is coded in a way that it won't get interferd with other touch related features in the game.
- **Area based D-Pad control:** the D-Pad uses an area specifed by the button node to detect touch input instead of some calculations from the slowish user script. Therefore, the user can easily change the area to detect touch input from with thin the editor instead of having to change some complicated calculation in the script!
- **Signal based control:** by using the signal, the code is very simple, reliable, and fast!
- **Muti-size D-Pad supported:** the user can easily change the D-Pad to any size as it won't break the code.
- **Flexible D-Pad position:** the user doesn't need the ultimate precision as the D-Pad will follow the user's thumb (in the limited area).
- **Auto D-Pad recenter:** the D-Pad will automatically return to its default positon. The user can sepacify the default position in the editor, there's no need to change this in the code.
- **Visual Script:** the code is written in Visual Script. Therefore, it's easy to read and understand if someone want to modify it.

## Usage
